Up to date info about Mautrix-telegram itself: [matrix-smsbot.md](matrix-smsbot.md)

## What?

An Matrix<->Slack bridge for bridging Slack-room to Matrix-room; puppets Slack-users to Matrix and for Slacks side an relaybot mimicks Matrix-user as Slack user. Also medias (mostly pictures tested) will work too.

## Set up
- General setup finds from: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack
- Ask details Matrix-channel: `#general:hacklab.fi` if you want to bridge Slack-room(s) to Matrix, as this needs collaboration from Slack workspace admin and hacklab.fi Matrix-admin.
